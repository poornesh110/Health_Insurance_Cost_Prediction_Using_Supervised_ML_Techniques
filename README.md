Health Insurance is an agreement between policy holder and policy company where the policy company ensures to cover medical expenses and policy holder agrees to pay premium amount in monthly, quarterly or yearly instalments. The calculation of premium amount is based on the attributes of policy holder and policy companies hire financial experts to predict the premium amount. Application of machine learning techniques in calculation of premium amount can increase the accuracy of calculation and decrease the error in calculation. In this project the insurance dataset was obtained from Kaggle which holds credibility and later data pre-processing was done. Five most popular regression models which are Multiple Linear Regression, KNN Regression, Decision Tree, Random forest regression and Support Vector Machine were applied. After model application based on the evaluation parameter Root Mean Squared Error and Cross validation technique two best performing models were selected. Later the two models are tuned with hyperparameter using Random and Grid search CV and after evaluation it was found that Random Forest Regression performs best and it was concluded as best performing model.
